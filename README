**Summary**

The fMRI technique has played a crucial role in exploring the neural representations of human image recognition. However, existing fMRI experimental datasets on masked image perception suffer from small sample sizes, limited modalities, and a lack of consideration for differences in cognitive load on task-related brain responses, making it challenging to draw reliable and consistent conclusions. This paper innovatively designs a paradigm for masked image perception experiments under varying cognitive load conditions. By implementing image perception tasks with three different levels of masking intensity, it induces low, medium, and high cognitive load levels, while monitoring and collecting resting-state fMRI, task-related fMRI, eye-tracking, and behavioral performance data from 66 participants. The "Multimodal Masked Image Perception Neurobehavioral Response Dataset" constructed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in experimental design, data modalities, and data quality, providing an important foundation for advancing the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying masked image perception and cognitive assessment.

**Data record**
he data were organized according to the Brain-Imaging-Data-Structure (BIDS) Specification version 1.7.0 and can be accessed from the OpenNeuro public repository (accession number: ds005047).The “sub-<subID>” folders store the raw data of each participant. The pre-processed volume data were saved as the “derivatives/pre-processed_volume_data/sub-<subID>” folders, while the pre-processed surface data were saved in the “derivatives/volumetosurface/sub-<subID>” folders.

*Stimulus*
Distinct folders store the stimuli for distinct fMRI experiments: "stimuli", "stimuli/floc", and "stimuli/prf" (Fig. 2b). The category labels and metadata corresponding to video stimuli are stored in the "stimuli/video-category-labels" and "stimuli/video-metadata" folders, respectively.

*Raw MRI data*
 Each participant's folder is comprised of 11 session folders: “sub-<subID>/ses-anat”, “sub-<subID>/ses-<sesID>”. The “ses-anat” folder comprises one folders, named “anat”. The “ses-<sesID>” folder comprises “fmap”and “func” two folders. A “sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_scans.tsv” file stores the scan information for a scan session. The task events were saved as “sub-<subID>/func/sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_task-<taskID>_run-<runID>_events.tsv” for each run.

*Freesurfer recon-all*
The results of reconstructing the cortical surface were saved as “recon-all-FreeSurfer/sub-<subID>” folders.

*Pre-processed volume data from pre-processing*
 The pre-processed volume-based fMRI data were saved as “pre-processed_volume_data/sub-<subID>/ses-<sesID>” folder. A“sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_task-<taskID>_volume_run-<runID>.nii” file stores  the pre-processed volumes data of a run. A “sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_task-<taskID>_volume_mean.nii” file stores the mean of the pre-processed volume data of a session. A “sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_task-<taskID>_volume_run-<runID>_timeseries.tsv” file stores the head motion of participants. The confounds parameters of co-registration alignment for a session were stored in a file named as “sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_task-<taskID>_alignment/alignment.mat”.

*Preprocessed surface-based data*
The pre-processed surface-based data were stored in a file named “volumetosurface/sub-<subID>/ses-<sesID>/sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_task-<taskID>_run-<index>_lh/rh.surfacedata.mat” for each run.

*Brain activation data from surface-based GLM analyses*
  The GLM analysis data from the main experiment for a scan session were stored in a file named “GLM/sub-<subID>/sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_task-task-<taskID>.mat” file. A “GLM/sub-<subID>/sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_task-<taskID>_mean.mat” file stores the mean of the GLM analysis data for the fLoc experiment.

*The technical validation of the NFED*
The code of technical validation were saved as “derivatives/validation/code” folder. The results of technical validation were saved as “derivatives/validation/results” folder.
